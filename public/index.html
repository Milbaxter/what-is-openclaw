It works inside the messaging apps you already use — WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, Slack, Discord, and more — connecting them to an AI brain like Claude or ChatGPT. Created by Peter Steinberger as a weekend project in November 2025, it has grown to over 100,000 GitHub stars, making it one of the fastest-growing open-source projects ever."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "OpenClaw has both strengths and risks when it comes to safety. On the positive side, it's open-source so anyone can inspect the code, and your data stays on your own machine rather than a company's servers. However, security researchers at Cisco found that some third-party add-ons (called 'skills') could steal data without users knowing. The project's own maintainers warn that it requires technical understanding to use safely. The AI industry as a whole still faces unsolved security challenges like prompt injection. Bottom line: it's powerful but requires caution."

Siri and Alexa are built into your devices but controlled by Apple and Amazon. OpenClaw runs on YOUR computer, works inside YOUR messaging apps, and you control everything. It's free and open-source, meaning no subscription fees for the software itself (though you still pay for the AI model you choose to use, typically around $20/month). Your conversations and data stay with you, not on a company's servers."

Several factors drove its popularity: it offers a 'Jarvis-like' 24/7 AI assistant experience; it gives users full privacy and control over their data; it works across 12+ messaging platforms people already use; it's completely free and open-source; and it represents a growing movement toward self-hosted AI tools that don't rely on big tech companies. The project also went through dramatic name changes (Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw) which generated additional buzz."

However, you will need to pay for an AI provider to power it — such as Claude by Anthropic or ChatGPT by OpenAI — which typically costs around $20 per month.

ChatGPT is a ready-to-use AI chat service you access through a website or app — it's simple, polished, and works out of the box. OpenClaw is a self-hosted platform that actually uses AI models like ChatGPT or Claude as its 'brain' while adding the ability to work across all your messaging apps, run 24/7, execute tasks autonomously, and keep your data on your own machine. OpenClaw gives you more control and flexibility, but requires technical knowledge to set up. For most non-technical users, ChatGPT is easier. For tech-savvy users who want full control, OpenClaw offers more power."

The recommended method is: 1) Install Node.js version 22 or later on your computer, 2) Run 'npm install -g openclaw@latest' in your terminal, 3) Run 'openclaw onboard' to start the setup wizard, which guides you through connecting your messaging apps and AI provider. OpenClaw runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2). There are also Docker and Nix installation options for advanced users. If you're not comfortable with command-line tools, you may want to ask a tech-savvy friend for help."

A few days later, the creator Peter Steinberger changed it again to "OpenClaw" because "Moltbot never quite rolled off the tongue."

              Yes, OpenClaw itself is completely free and open-source. You can download, install, and use it without paying anything for the software.

              They serve different purposes. ChatGPT is a ready-to-use AI chat service &mdash; simple, polished, works out of the box. OpenClaw is a self-hosted platform that actually uses AI models like ChatGPT or Claude as its "brain" while adding the ability to work across all your messaging apps, run 24/7, and keep your data on your own machine. For most non-technical users, ChatGPT is easier. For tech-savvy users who want full control, OpenClaw offers more power.

              Installing OpenClaw requires some technical knowledge. The recommended method is: install Node.js version 22 or later, run "npm install -g openclaw@latest" in your terminal, then run "openclaw onboard" to start the setup wizard. It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2). There are also Docker and Nix options for advanced users. If you're not comfortable with command-line tools, you may want to ask a tech-savvy friend for help.

              OpenClaw runs on your own machine, so it has access to whatever you grant it. By default, it processes messages through an AI provider like Claude or ChatGPT, but your data isn't stored on anyone else's servers by OpenClaw itself. However, third-party "skills" (add-ons) can potentially access your data, which is why security researchers recommend only installing skills from trusted sources. You control what OpenClaw can access through its configuration.

It's become one of the most recognizable symbols in the open-source AI community.

      <h2 class="reveal">The complete guide to OpenClaw in 2026</h2>

      <article class="seo-article reveal reveal-delay-1">
        <h3 id="what-is-openclaw-explained">What is OpenClaw? A simple explanation</h3>
        <p>OpenClaw is a free, open-source personal AI assistant that runs on your own computer. Unlike cloud-based assistants like ChatGPT, Siri, or Google Assistant, OpenClaw gives you full ownership and control over your AI. It connects to the messaging apps you already use every day &mdash; WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, Slack, Discord, and many more &mdash; and acts as an intelligent assistant available 24/7 in your chats.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to think about it: imagine if you could have a brilliant assistant living inside your WhatsApp, ready to answer questions, help with tasks, and learn your preferences &mdash; all while keeping your private conversations on your own machine rather than someone else's servers.</p>

        <h3 id="openclaw-history">The history of OpenClaw: from weekend project to global phenomenon</h3>
        <p>OpenClaw was created by Peter Steinberger, an Austrian software developer, in November 2025. It started as a simple "WhatsApp relay" &mdash; a way to connect WhatsApp to an AI model. The project was originally called <strong>Clawdbot</strong>.</p>
        <p>In January 2026, Anthropic (the company behind Claude AI) raised trademark concerns, and the project was renamed to <strong>Moltbot</strong>. Just days later, Steinberger changed the name again to <strong>OpenClaw</strong>, saying "Moltbot never quite rolled off the tongue." The lobster emoji 🦞 became the project's beloved mascot.</p>
        <p>The growth was explosive: OpenClaw jumped from 9,000 to over 60,000 GitHub stars in a single week, eventually surpassing 100,000 stars. It drew 2 million visitors in seven days, making it one of the fastest-growing open-source projects in history.</p>

        <h3 id="how-openclaw-works">How does OpenClaw work?</h3>
        <p>At its core, OpenClaw is a bridge between your messaging apps and an AI model. Here's how it works in simple terms:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>You send a message</strong> through any supported app (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>OpenClaw receives it</strong> through its Gateway &mdash; a local control center running on your computer</li>
          <li><strong>The message goes to an AI</strong> (like Claude or ChatGPT) which thinks about your question</li>
          <li><strong>The AI's response comes back</strong> to OpenClaw, which sends it to you in the same messaging app</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All of this happens on your own machine. The only data that leaves your computer is the message content sent to your chosen AI provider for processing.</p>

        <h3 id="openclaw-vs-chatgpt-vs-siri">OpenClaw vs ChatGPT vs Siri vs Alexa: what's the difference?</h3>
        <p><strong>ChatGPT</strong> is a web-based AI you access through OpenAI's website or app. Your conversations are stored on OpenAI's servers. It's easy to use but you have limited control.</p>
        <p><strong>Siri and Alexa</strong> are voice assistants built into Apple and Amazon devices. They're convenient but controlled entirely by those companies, with limited customization.</p>
        <p><strong>OpenClaw</strong> runs on your own hardware, works across all your messaging apps, and gives you complete control. It can use Claude, ChatGPT, or other AI models as its "brain." You own your data, you choose what it can access, and you can extend it with custom skills.</p>
        <p>The trade-off: OpenClaw requires technical knowledge to set up, while ChatGPT and Siri work out of the box.</p>

        <h3 id="openclaw-supported-apps">What apps does OpenClaw support?</h3>
        <p>OpenClaw supports an impressive list of messaging platforms: <strong>WhatsApp</strong>, <strong>Telegram</strong>, <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>Discord</strong>, <strong>Google Chat</strong>, <strong>Signal</strong>, <strong>iMessage</strong> (via BlueBubbles), <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong>, <strong>Matrix</strong>, <strong>Zalo</strong>, <strong>Twitch</strong>, and a built-in <strong>WebChat</strong> interface. New platforms are added regularly by the community.</p>

        <h3 id="is-openclaw-safe">Is OpenClaw safe? An honest assessment</h3>
        <p>This is the most important question many people have about OpenClaw, and it deserves an honest answer:</p>
        <p><strong>The good:</strong> OpenClaw is open-source, meaning anyone can inspect the code for security issues. It runs on your own machine, so your data isn't stored on a company's servers. You choose exactly which AI provider to use and what permissions to grant.</p>
        <p><strong>The concerns:</strong> Cisco's AI security research team tested a third-party OpenClaw skill and found it performed data exfiltration and prompt injection without user awareness. One of OpenClaw's own maintainers warned that "if you can't understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely." The AI industry as a whole still faces the unsolved problem of prompt injection.</p>
        <p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> OpenClaw is a powerful tool that can be used safely by people who understand what they're doing. For non-technical users, it's better to wait until the project matures further or get help from someone experienced.</p>

        <h3 id="openclaw-for-beginners">Can beginners use OpenClaw?</h3>
        <p>Currently, OpenClaw is primarily designed for technically-minded users. Setting it up requires using a command-line terminal, installing Node.js, managing API keys, and understanding basic networking concepts. The project has an onboarding wizard ("openclaw onboard") that simplifies the process, and some hosting providers offer one-click installs, but it's still not at the "download an app" stage.</p>
        <p>If you're not technical, this website exists specifically to help you understand what OpenClaw is and whether it's worth exploring. Our voice agent can answer all your questions in plain language.</p>
