For high-stakes enterprise deployments, there are real concerns: Cisco's security team found data exfiltration risks in third-party skills, prompt injection remains an industry-wide unsolved problem, and the project's own maintainers warn about the technical knowledge required."

Your costs come from three places: the AI provider (Claude or ChatGPT API, typically $20-100/month depending on usage), hosting ($5-50/month on a VPS or cloud instance), and any premium skills or integrations. For a small team, total costs are $50-150/month. Compare this to ChatGPT Enterprise at $60/user/month or Microsoft Copilot at $30/user/month."

OpenClaw is free and gives you full ownership, data residency, and limitless customization — but you're responsible for hosting, security, and maintenance.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">OpenClaw is a free, open-source AI assistant that runs on your own infrastructure and connects to the messaging platforms your team already uses &mdash; Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Teams, and more. Created by Peter Steinberger as a weekend project in November 2025, it exploded to 100,000+ GitHub stars and became one of the fastest-growing open-source projects in history.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">Unlike ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you own the deployment. Your data never leaves your servers. You choose the AI model (Claude, ChatGPT, or others), customize behavior with a growing ecosystem of skills via ClawHub, and pay only for the AI provider &mdash; not per-seat licensing fees.</p>
        <p>The question is no longer <em>what</em> OpenClaw is. It's whether it's the right fit for <em>your</em> business &mdash; and that's exactly what our expert is here to help you figure out.</p>

              It depends on your use case and risk tolerance. Many teams are running OpenClaw in production for internal tools and low-stakes customer interactions. For high-stakes enterprise deployments, there are real concerns: Cisco's security team found data exfiltration risks in third-party skills, prompt injection remains an industry-wide unsolved problem, and one of OpenClaw's own maintainers warned about the technical knowledge required. The expert can assess your specific situation.

              OpenClaw itself is free. Your costs come from three places: the AI provider (Claude or ChatGPT API, typically $20&ndash;100/month depending on usage), hosting ($5&ndash;50/month on a VPS or cloud instance), and any premium skills or integrations. For a small team, you're looking at $50&ndash;150/month total. At scale, the API costs dominate. The expert can help you model costs for your specific use case and usage patterns.

              No. This is an independent project. We aggregated the best knowledge from across the OpenClaw ecosystem &mdash; power user blogs, community discussions, security research, deployment case studies &mdash; and built an expert voice agent that can discuss it all in depth. Think of it as the consultant you'd hire to evaluate OpenClaw for your business, except it costs €8 instead of €8,000.

              OpenClaw went from 9,000 to 100,000+ GitHub stars in a single week. But the real story isn't the hype &mdash; it's what happened after. Businesses started deploying it. The appeal is simple: a self-hosted AI assistant that connects to Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, and a dozen other messaging platforms your team already uses &mdash; with full data ownership, no per-seat licensing, and limitless customization through its skills system.

              Honest advice from the community: don't use OpenClaw if you need SOC 2 compliance out of the box, if your team doesn't have anyone comfortable with a command line, if you need enterprise-grade SLAs, or if you're handling highly regulated data (healthcare, finance) without a dedicated security team to audit the deployment. In those cases, ChatGPT Enterprise or a purpose-built enterprise AI platform is the safer bet.

              Self-hosted means your data stays on your machine &mdash; not in someone else&rsquo;s cloud. That is a major privacy advantage over hosted AI tools. The code is fully open source, so anyone can audit it. The AI provider does see your prompts, so their privacy policy applies. For full privacy, local models through Ollama keep everything on your hardware, though they are less capable. Use a dedicated machine and verified skills for best security.

              OpenClaw is not locked to one provider. Claude by Anthropic is the most popular choice. GPT by OpenAI is a solid alternative. Grok by xAI includes web search. Kimi is popular as a cheaper sub-agent. Local models run free through Ollama but are less capable. The recommended setup is a powerful model like Claude Opus as the main agent with a cheaper model for simpler tasks. A tool called LLM Router can automatically switch between them.
